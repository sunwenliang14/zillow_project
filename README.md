In this zillow project, I will do research on the drivers of the values of single family residential properties in the United States. The data I am going to use is collected from zillow database.

I'm going to use the properties' features such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, squarefeet as independent variables, the aproperties' tax value as dependent variables, to look over relationships among independent variables as well as relationships between independent variables and dependent variabe.
